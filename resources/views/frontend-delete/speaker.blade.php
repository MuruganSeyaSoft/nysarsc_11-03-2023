                          Mental health services offered to the elderly where they reside are very limited. Ms DiMarco, inspired by this 
                          challenge, created American Elder Care Coordination, an umbrella agency to bring geriatric service providers together
                           to focus on the most immediate needs of the elderly. The Mental Health Alliance is the first program to come from 
                           this collaboration which puts licensed clinical therapists in the homes of seniors looking for therapy services.
                             Jamie is excited to be able to share knowledge about mental health services for the elderly.</p>
